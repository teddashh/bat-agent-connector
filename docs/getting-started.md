## Choose the matching candidate package

[PR #81](https://github.com/teddashh/bat-agent-connector/pull/81) implements the normal desktop setup below. It is not yet merged, and final checks are still running. Open its [checks](https://github.com/teddashh/bat-agent-connector/pull/81/checks), follow the desktop run and use an artifact from the same source commit whose platform job succeeded. Earlier release assets do not automatically include this runtime. [Desktop workflow](https://github.com/teddashh/bat-agent-connector/actions/workflows/desktop.yml).

| Platform | Artifact | Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | `desktop-Windows-unsigned` | NSIS `.exe` |
| Mac Apple Silicon | `desktop-macOS-arm64-validation` | `.dmg` |
| Mac Intel | `desktop-macOS-x64-validation` | `.dmg` |
| Linux | `desktop-Linux-unsigned` | `.deb` |

GitHub artifacts may require sign-in and expire. Windows validation packages are unsigned; Mac bundles use ad-hoc signing. Formal signing, Mac notarization, production update channels and a Linux persistent native credential vault are outside this delivery. No new stable release is claimed here.

## First launch: your local Connector

Install and open the matching package. It contains the Python runtime and prepares one private local central, its data and your personal identity. You do not install Python / uv, enter an actor, edit credential files or copy an API token for this path. The initial Dashboard opens **Get ready to work** when no BAT host is configured.

**Windows Fleet manages local connections and startup; Python Connector / Task Service authorizes and dispatches work; BAT executes it on the selected host.** A remote BAT host does not require BAT to be installed on the Dashboard computer. Windows Fleet settings remain separate from central onboarding.

### 1. Connect BAT

In **Connection / Fleet → Get ready to work → Connect BAT**, select a **BAT connection profile** if it is importable. Otherwise choose **Configure a host manually** and enter **Host name**, **BAT endpoint**, the trusted **Host certificate SHA-256 fingerprint**, **Workspace profile ID** and **BAT connection token**. Confirm the fingerprint with the host owner. Encrypted or damaged BAT profile credentials are shown as unavailable; enter a valid token in the form rather than bypassing trust checks.

Expand **Allow managed work** when enabling dispatch. Choose the intended conversation / start permissions and dedicated **Remote managed directories**. For Git synchronization, checkpoint and artifact operations, provide the existing trusted **SSH alias configured on this computer**. The SSH account, keys, known host and remote permissions must already be usable; the app does not invent them.

**Allow Git worktrees sharing a clone** is an explicit opt-in when a direct BAT start needs shared Git metadata. Leave it off when that is not intended. It does not grant control over manual sessions or worktrees. Click **Verify and save host**; the connection/profile checks are read-only and saving does not dispatch work.

### 2. Bind a GitHub repository

Under **Bind a GitHub repository**, enter `owner/repository` and the configured host. Use **Read this host's workspaces**, then choose the actual **BAT workspace ID**. Supply the **Git remote URL** and GitHub token when required. Enable integration, PR merge or metadata updates only for the intended workflow, then click **Verify and bind repository**.

The repository-to-host/workspace association is explicit. A similar project name, folder or remote URL is not a substitute for that binding. Verification reads BAT/GitHub; it does not push, create a PR or merge. Published-source dispatch additionally needs managed start permissions, a dedicated remote root and the trusted SSH alias. Deployment recipes remain separately configured.

### 3. Configure verification commands when needed

**Configure verification commands** applies to Task Service projects. Enter the exact **Task Service project name**, **Executable**, **Arguments (one per line)** and **Timeout in seconds (1–3600)**. Each nonempty argument line becomes one literal argument; spaces within it are retained. Shell quoting, pipes and expansion are not interpreted. Do not enter credentials.

**Save verification command** records the command without executing it. Other project commands are preserved; the timeout applies to all configured projects. Use the task's actual project key; it is not automatically mapped from a Dashboard project ID or title. If central configuration changed while editing, reload the saved verification settings, review the preserved draft and save again. Verification runs later only through the existing task, ownership and execution gates.

### 4. Start and follow work

Open **Projects**, associate the project with the configured repository, choose the bound host/workspace and review a fixed source commit before dispatching instructions, a model and optional attachment revisions. Same-host continuation can use a fixed local checkpoint; another host uses an explicitly published commit through the bound repository. Manual source work stays read-only.

The adjustable left tree keeps the selected conversation, reply controls and result links together. A send receipt records that request's outcome; a historical queued receipt is not the current BAT queue position. Model preferences affect the offered selection, not provider authorization. Saved skill selections pin reviewed catalog sources and are not automatic activation in a running agent. **Create repair work** records fixed failure evidence; review its destination and source before starting the new work.

### Background, browser and recovery

Use **Open Dashboard in browser** or the tray / menu-bar entry. The app hands off a one-use sign-in ticket; the long-lived API token stays out of URLs and browser storage. Web and Tauri use the same central identity and journal. After browser logout, reopen from the desktop entry.

Enable **Start when I sign in** for this installation's login startup. Closing Web or the Dashboard window leaves central running. Explicit desktop Quit retains central work while following the separate Fleet shutdown guards. Reopening recovers the same installation; a newer package upgrades only after the owned service accepts a safe stop. Busy or uncertain work prevents that transition, and older packages do not downgrade the journal.

Configuration changes wait while operations/tasks are active. If a reply is lost, use **Recover original setup request** and **View setup operation**; do not submit a new request to guess the outcome. Expired credentials, invalid ownership or failed startup are recovery states, not reasons to create another database.

## Advanced: existing central and operator deployment

Existing desktop central configuration is retained. To join a different service explicitly, use **Advanced: join an existing central**, then enroll its separate credential. The remaining sections describe an operator-managed central; they are not prerequisites for the normal bundled installation.

### 1. Prepare a central host

The following operator example uses Linux and Python 3.10–3.13. This is separate from the bundled desktop path. Central needs access to BAT; managed Git work also needs configured SSH / Git access, a Connector-owned managed root and an explicit repository binding.

The two credentials serve different purposes:

| Credential | Used by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BAT remote token | Connector to a BAT host | Access BAT's remote protocol, with its certificate fingerprint pinned. |
| Connector API token | Dashboard or MCP client to central | Identify the caller and authorize central actions. Issue one per client / actor. |

Do not use a BAT remote token in the Dashboard API login field.

### 2. Install Connector

Install with `uv` on the central host. Until a formal release is selected, pin a reviewed commit instead of silently following changing `main`. Replace `REVIEWED_COMMIT` with the reviewed source commit matching your chosen desktop / service deployment:

```bash
uv tool install 'git+https://github.com/teddashh/bat-agent-connector@REVIEWED_COMMIT'
batc --help
```

A development checkout can instead use `uv sync --locked --extra dev`, with `uv run batc` for the commands below. Keep the desktop and central contract versions compatible; the desktop refuses incompatible identity / contracts.

### 3. Configure BAT access

If this host has the BAT desktop client's profiles:

```bash
batc import-bat
batc hosts
```

Import writes `~/.config/bat-agent-connector/hosts.toml` with writes disabled. It stores the endpoint, pinned TLS fingerprint and a **token reference**, not the token value. `batc hosts` probes configured hosts; a successful probe does not prove Git access or deployment readiness.

For a different profile location, use `batc import-bat --profiles-dir /path/to/profiles`. Preview generated configuration with `--output -`. Do not add `--force` merely to bypass an existing configuration.

Without local BAT profiles, configure [hosts.example.toml](../examples/hosts.example.toml) with the actual BAT endpoint, trusted fingerprint and an appropriate `token_ref`:

- `env:NAME`: resolve from the service's private environment.
- `file:/path`: resolve from a private token file.
- `bat-profile:ID`: resolve from the supported BAT client token store.

A default profile path is not a cross-platform discovery guarantee. Preserve the original BAT configuration and keep credentials out of source control.

### 4. Start central and open Web

Run the service in one terminal on the central host:

```bash
batc serve
```

The default is `127.0.0.1:18796`. The process must keep running; this command does not install an autostart service. An already owned service may report `OWNER_CONFLICT`: use that owner instead of creating another database.

In a second terminal on the same host, issue an observation identity:

```bash
batc api-token issue --actor personal-dashboard --scope observe
```

The token is printed once. Keep it private. Open `http://127.0.0.1:18796/dashboard/` on that host and use the Connection screen to sign in. Pending, Projects and Sessions should become available. This initial identity intentionally cannot dispatch or edit work.

If the central host is remote, use an existing verified tunnel. An example with a previously configured and trusted SSH alias is:

```bash
ssh -N -L 18796:127.0.0.1:18796 central-alias
```

Then open the same loopback Dashboard address on the client machine. Keep that tunnel running. Do not expose the service by changing its bind address or disabling Host / Origin checks. The service does not currently provide a general public-hosting ingress.

### 5. Join that external central from desktop

On a managed desktop, choose **Advanced: join an existing central** in Connection settings. Enter the trusted central address and expected actor, confirm in the native window, then enroll that central's API token through **Add credential**. Windows uses Credential Manager; Mac uses Keychain. The old managed service and its work remain intact; its personal credential is never forwarded to the external address.

An existing `central.json` remains selected on upgrade, including when it needs repair. A failed external connection never creates a local replacement database. For an older client-only package, this external-central form is its normal connection screen; that does not prove the package contains the new bundled runtime.

For an external central on Linux, native credential enrollment remains memory-only through `BATC_DESKTOP_TOKEN`; browser login is another supported entry. This limitation does not prevent the candidate's local managed installation from owning a private service credential. [Native configuration and credentials](design/desktop.md#configure-the-native-client).

**Forget saved credential** removes only the local saved credential; it does not revoke the central token. Windows Fleet has separate connection / login choices described in the [Windows guide](windows.md).

### 6. Enable useful work deliberately

Observation working is the first checkpoint. For actual dispatch, the operator configures:

1. The selected host's `writes` and `orchestrate` gates, owned managed root, Git / SSH runner and confinement policy.
2. An explicit repository-to-host/workspace binding under the existing `github.repos` configuration. A project name, workspace path or Git remote alone is not that binding.
3. The client's scopes for the intended action. A typical project-dispatch identity needs `observe`, `manage` and `start`; session interaction uses `operate`. Integration, acceptance, merge, deployment and cleanup have separate scopes.

Example binding (replace every demonstration value with the reviewed destination):

```toml
[[github.repos]]
repository = "example/project"
sync = { remote_url = "git@github.com:example/project.git", bindings = [{ host = "worker", workspace_id = "exact-workspace-id" }] }
```

This snippet is not the complete host / GitHub configuration and does not grant integration push or deployment permission. Follow [repository setup](design/repository-sync.md) and the [configuration example](../examples/hosts.example.toml).

In Dashboard, create a project and explicitly choose its configured repository. Open project dispatch, choose the destination and branch, review its fixed commit, add original instructions and optional attachments / model, then submit. Return to the project to follow the work and its delivery entry.

Read the integration preview before adding results to a PR. Merge and deployment require their own configuration and scopes; deployment additionally needs a recipe with actual source-version / health verification. [Delivery setup](design/delivery.md).

## CLI and agent access

The CLI offers the same observation and operation records:

```bash
batc hosts
batc inventory
batc history --help
batc relations --help
batc op --help
batc repository --help
batc delivery --help
batc resource-cleanup --help
```

Register `bat-agent-connector-mcp` in the MCP client's supported configuration. A common read-only JSON form is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bat": {
      "command": "bat-agent-connector-mcp",
      "args": ["--principal-only", "--read-only"]
    }
  }
}
```

Run the configured central service and give this MCP process its own scoped `BATC_API_TOKEN` through private environment configuration, including `observe` for reads. Ensure it can find the executable and intended configuration. `--principal-only` keeps the agent on its authenticated central identity; retain it when enabling writes. Remove only `--read-only` when the client is meant to act; host gates and scopes still apply. Set `BATC_TASK_URL` privately if central uses a different RPC endpoint.

The operator compatibility mode without `--principal-only` includes local-admin read fallback and direct Fleet tools. It is not a scope-isolated agent endpoint. A trusted local operator can use `bat-agent-connector-mcp --read-only` for direct BAT observation without the central workflow, but this is not the default for a shared agent integration.

The optional loopback MCP HTTP transport is a separate adapter:

```bash
bat-agent-connector-mcp --principal-only --read-only --http --port 8765
```

This serves MCP at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`; it is not the Web Dashboard address. Use the [canonical skill](../skills/bat-agent-connector/SKILL.md) and [matching agent adapters](agent-skills.md) for durable work and recovery. Task Service recipes have additional settings; a queued task with the planner disabled does not prove dispatch failure. [Task Service](design/task-service.md).

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to check / do |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop asks for an external central / actor | Check whether this is an older client-only artifact or an existing external configuration. On the matching managed candidate, ordinary first launch prepares local central automatically. |
| Managed startup or upgrade needs attention | Preserve its installation/data. Reopen the matching app; unresolved work or credentials can prevent startup/upgrade. Do not delete the journal or create a second owner. |
| BAT profile cannot be imported | Check profile metadata, certificate trust and credential availability. Use manual host entry if its token store is encrypted or damaged. |
| Connected but no hosts / sessions | Review **Connect BAT** and actual host reachability. Offline or stale observations do not prove work stopped. |
| No destination in project dispatch | Save the exact repository/host/workspace binding and associate the project with that repository. |
| Setup is busy or a receipt is missing | Let active work settle; recover the original setup request and operation before changing it. |
| An action is disabled | Read its scopes, host permissions, ownership and source/binding requirements. |
| A send/start reply is lost | Keep its operation ID and request key; read back instead of dispatching again. |
| Native BAT merge acknowledgement stays unknown | Preserve its original operation and resources. The separate human-adjudication API is outside the current merge contract. |
| Cleanup is refused | Read the retention reasons; unresolved writers and unique content must remain. |
| Fleet does not start | Check its selected connections, Kit configuration, prerequisites and ownership. An omitted backend retains PowerShell compatibility; installing Dashboard does not migrate it to Rust. |

Real Fleet/account/deployment acceptance is performed by the user. The [46-item acceptance reference](product/acceptance-v2.md) remains useful for that work; it is excluded from the agent's completion checklist, not reported as already passed.
