# Shared dashboard design

This is an operational console: compact, factual and legible. Preserve the existing
browser and native shared source in `src/`; do not introduce a parallel visual theme.

## Palette and type

Use the semantic variables in `src/app.css`, including its dark theme. Light values:
background `--bg: #f6f7f9`, panel `--panel: #fff`, text `--text: #1d2330`, secondary
`--muted: #5d6676`, border `--line: #dfe3ea`, action `--accent: #2f5bd3`, action text
`--accent-text: #fff`. Reuse `--ok`, `--warn`, `--bad`, `--info` for evidence states.
System UI / Segoe UI / Noto Sans TC is the shared stack; body is 15px/1.5,
page headings 20px and section headings 16px. Supporting orchestration text is 14px.

## Components and layout

Reuse `.panel` (14px padding, 10px radius, 1px border), `.capture-fields` (8px gap,
wrapping 220px field basis), `.actions` (8px gap) and the primary/secondary/danger
button variants (8px radius, 8px 14px padding). One primary submission per form.
Authenticated views use a persistent 260px project/work sidebar (230px below 1200px)
and a flexible content area. The selected session puts conversation and reply first,
with a 280px work/results inspector beside it at 1200px and above. Narrower screens
place the inspector below the conversation; below 800px a button expands the tree.
Connection-only screens retain the 1100px container; long forms may narrow to 820px.
No new shadows or floating layers. Place status and recovery beside the original
request. Exact IDs and literal inputs must wrap, never disappear behind ellipsis.

## Interaction and responsive behavior

At 640px, forms wrap to one column, action targets are at least 44px and editable
controls are 16px to avoid mobile zoom. Preserve focused drafts during event reads.
Show disabled controls with a concrete scope or evidence explanation. Mark partial
inventory and unknown receipts honestly. Text, icons and color must not imply a
successful effect without central evidence. Never render agent-provided markup.

## Agent guide

Extract existing CSS tokens before adding UI. Use a compact selection panel and
instruction section for a new action; use receipt links for multi-effect outcomes.
Avoid decorative cards, oversized headings, extra primary buttons or a second font.
Check both locales and 390/768/1440 widths with real screenshots before delivery.
