## Project Hub

The project and work item rules in `src/bat_agent_connector/work_items.py` are ported from Project Hub v4.68.2
(<https://github.com/kieiken/project-hub>, commit `031aedd4bf62ef4bb1e6199c31aa9c4323a116bb`):

| Project Hub file | Ported to | What was kept |
|---|---|---|
| `hub/lib/hierarchy.js` | `work_items.py` (`project.update`, `work_item.update`) | renames keep IDs and relations; a change names the version it was read at |
| `hub/lib/project-order.js`, `hub/public/project-order.js` | `work_items.siblings`, `_check_order`, `_save_order` | one saved order per parent, pins first, the order you saw as a precondition, archived entries keep their slot, unplaced branches after their source |
| `hub/lib/completion.js` | `work_items.completion`, `work_item.approve`, `work_item.continue` | an agent's done is a claim a person approves against a content fingerprint; a content change asks again; "keep working" holds for the current steps |
| `hub/lib/task-ids.js` | `work_items.py` IDs | IDs are never reused |

Changes are listed in [docs/design/work-items.md](docs/design/work-items.md). Project Hub's license:
