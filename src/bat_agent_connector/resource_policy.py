"""Resource ownership policy: which BAT sessions, worktrees and checkouts the connector may change.

Every BAT write frame needs a ``WriteGrant`` from this module; ``BatClient`` refuses a write
channel without one, so no tool, CLI command or task path can reach BAT around these checks.
The design and the evidence rules are in docs/design/resource-policy.md.

Provenance of a session:

* ``connector_managed``: the connector's own registry row shows it created the session (or the
  task journal proved it on recovery) and BAT acknowledged the start.
* ``manual``: a BAT workspace tab with no connector creation record. Permanently read-only.
* ``unknown``: no proof either way, or a creation that BAT never acknowledged. Read-only until
  the creation is reconciled.

Session ownership and folder ownership are separate checks. A connector-managed session may only
be driven while its working folder is one the connector owns: a configured managed root, or a
worktree the connector itself created. A connector session in a human checkout is a legacy
boundary and stays read-only too.
